# Fundaments of Programming and Data Management ModA-B
This is a project I did as part of the Universities of Programming and Data Management course, one of the courses at Federico University.

The aim of this project is to create a structured dataset containing regulatory and clinical information on licensed drugs in Italy. As part of the project, publicly available official data provided by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) were systematically collected, including both lists of prescription drugs and their corresponding clinical descriptions. 
The data collection process was largely carried out manually. For each drug, relevant sections were extracted from the “Riassunto delle Caratteristiche del Prodotto (RCP)” documents through individual searches. The project specifically focused on "Class A" and "Class H" drugs, which were merged, cleaned, and standardized into a unified data structure. 
The resulting dataset is intended to enable meaningful insights in both healthcare analytics and pharmaceutical policy development. It aims to serve as a robust resource for the development of clinical decision support systems, drug safety analyses, and therapeutic evaluations.
